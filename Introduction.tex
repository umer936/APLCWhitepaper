\chapter{Introduction}

What do you want to be when you grow older? Ever since we can remember, this question has been repeatedly pounded into our brains by our parents, teachers, and friends. Think back to those days in elementary school where activities such as “Bring Your Parents to School Day” abounded. Activities such as these were created by our schools, so that we could learn more about the potential careers that society would one day force us to choose. For some people, the answer to this question has always been very apparent. However, for the majority of us, this question is one of life’s great mysteries. Now, as we get closer to graduating and begin to prepare for college, this dreadful day seems to loom right over the horizon. Juniors all over the world are quaking in fear knowing that the time for them to decide their futures has come. Okay, I admit that this may have been a bit of a stretch, but in all honesty people are genuinely nervous about what they are going to study in college and what they are going to do afterwards. Acknowledging this ever-growing problem, we decided to create a handy-dandy guide that will help you out in these life defining decisions. So sit back, relax, read, and go out into the world with a little less fear and a lot more confidence.
